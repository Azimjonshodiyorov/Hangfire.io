* **Fixed** – `ToGenericTypeString` method now handles types with no namespace correctly.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – Prevent `ExpirationManager`'s command from timing out, when there are a lot of records.
* **Fixed** – `CountersAggregator` issue introduced in 1.6.2, that causes slow record aggregation.
* **Fixed** – Add `XLOCK` hint for `CountersAggregator` query to prevent deadlocks on lock escalation.

**Hangfire.SqlServer.Msmq**

* **Fixed** – Prevent MSMQ transactions from timing out after 1 minute of processing.
