Maintenance release with fixed recurring jobs behavior when they were scheduled to the past after calling the `AddOrUpdate` method in some corner cases, and added experimental parallel execution for recurring and delayed job schedulers via the new `MaxDegreeOfParallelismForSchedulers` option when supported by a storage implementation. The fixes are also backported to version 1.7.37.

#### Hangfire.Core

* **Added** – `MaxDegreeOfParallelismForSchedulers` experimental server option if supported by storage.
* **Added** – Experimental support for parallel execution of the delayed job scheduler.
* **Added** – Experimental support for parallel execution of the recurring job scheduler.
* **Fixed** – Recurring job is scheduled to the past after recovering from error with `AddOrUpdate`.
* **Fixed** – `AddOrUpdate` triggers execution of a recurring job, even if its next execution is in the future.
* **Fixed** – Two very minor errors in the Swedish localization file (by @Uglack).

#### Hangfire.SqlServer

* **Fixed** – Populate `InvocationData` and `LoadException` properties in `JobDetails` method results.
