This release fixes possibly hanging continuations for background jobs which belong to a canceled batch. Problem was caused by wrong execution order between `BatchSupport` and `ContinuationsSupport` filters, and the former now runs before the latter to give it a chance to recognize antecedent background job was deleted.

* **Changed** – Order of the `BatchSupport` filter was changed from 2000 to 950 to fire earlier than `ContinuationsSupport`.
* **Fixed** – Continuations hanging in the `Awaiting` state when antecedent background job belong to a canceled batch.
