title: Hangfire.Pro.Redis 2.6.2
category: [release, hangfire-pro]

This release is unrelated to the previous ones and fixes wrong behavior when [non-recommended](https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/configuration/using-redis.html#redis-configuration) max-memory policy is used in Redis, such as `volatile-*` one. I still don't recommend to use other than `noeviction` policies, but at least the following case is handled better.

* **Fixed** â€“ Don't create orphaned jobs under high memory pressure in Redis with "volatile-*" max-memory policies.
