Starting from Mar 1, 2022 Hangfire will be owned by <a href="https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/16452321/Hangfire-OÜ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hangfire OÜ</a>, an Estonian company. This change relates only to company residence and structure to mitigate the possible risks and move on, and it's still owned by me. Payments, private NuGet feed, technical support and GitHub repositories are unaffected by this change, everything remains the same. In the near future I will contact all customers with custom EULAs to give an option to re-sign the license with the new entity.

I'm working hard to complete the transition, hope for your patience. Please feel free to ask any questions via <a href="mailto:support@hangfire.io">support@hangfire.io</a>.
