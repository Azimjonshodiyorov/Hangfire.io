title: Hangfire.Pro.Redis 2.8.10
category: [release, hangfire-pro]

This maintenance release forces Hangfire.Pro.Redis to always use dedicated threads for reading Redis responses, even on Windows where IOCP threads were used by default. This will help to avoid slowdowns and timeout exceptions when all IOCP threads are busy or blocked by user code. This change is made because System.Net.Http.HttpClient package began to leak IOCP threads to user code, starting from one of the recent versions.

* **Changed** – Use dedicated threads instead of IOCP ones for reading Redis responses by default on Windows.
* **Fixed** – Timeout exceptions when IOCP thread usage is high (can be caused by System.Net.Http.HttpClient).
* **Fixed** – Overall slowdown when IOCP thread usage is high (can be caused by System.Net.Http.HttpClient).
