summary: Better waiting logic for sliding invisibility-based fetch, SQL server as a time authority for heartbeats.
---

Patch release that implements sliding invisibility-based fetch logic with waiting on client's side instead of SQL Server's one (so wait statistics will be clear now) and uses SQL Server as a time authority for server heartbeats (unsynchronized clock will not cause servers to suddently disappear). Also implemented `IAsyncDisposable` support for service scopes in modern .NET Core applications.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Changed** – Use SQL Server as a time authority for server heartbeats.
* **Changed** – Increase `MinPollingDelayMs` for SQL Server to 100 milliseconds.
* **Changed** – Don't wait on SQL Server's side when using long polling for fetching.

**Hangfire.AspNetCore**

* **Fixed** – Implement support `IAsyncDisposable` for `IServiceScope` instances for newer .NET platforms.
