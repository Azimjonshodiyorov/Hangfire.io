This is a patch release that slightly improves the shutdown pipeline of a background job server and allows to get the current server id from `IServerFilter` implementations.

#### Hangfire.Core

* **Added** – Pass server id from a worker to the `PerformContext.ServerId` property available in filters.
* **Fixed** – Send heartbeats until full background processing server shutdown.
      
#### Hangfire.NetCore

* **Changed** – Send the stop signal earlier in the shutdown pipeline when hosting in .NET Core 3.1 or higher.
* **Changed** – Set processing server to null in hosted service to avoid `ObjectDisposedException`.
* **Fixed** – Other `IHostedService` implementations can block Hangfire server from being stopped.
