The `RedisStorageOptions.MaxStateHistoryLength` option is added in this release to limit the number of state history entries and avoid storage leak when some background job is rescheduled again and again. By default, only 10 state history entries are now persisted, but this value can be configured with the new option.

* **Added** – `RedisStorageOptions.MaxStateHistoryLength` option to cap the number of state history entries.
* **Changed** – Only 10 last state history entries now persisted by default for background jobs (configurable).
* **Fixed** – Avoid uncontrollable memory growth in Redis when particular job is constantly being rescheduled.
