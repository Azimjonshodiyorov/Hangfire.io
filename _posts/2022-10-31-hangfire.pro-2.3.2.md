This patch version fixes possible "stuck batch" issue when state of a job inside a batch continuation is changed externally before that batch continuation is started. Such state transitions shouldn't be used, because they violate encapsulation, but nevertheless while they aren't prohibited by the code, we should handle such cases somehow.

* **Fixed** â€“ Possible external state changes for jobs in batch continuations should not lead to stuck batches.
