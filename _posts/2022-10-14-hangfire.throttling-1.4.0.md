category: release
author: odinserj
---

As with mutexes, it is now possible to apply a semaphore to the entire batch by using a special technique, please see the [Throttling Batches](https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/background-processing/throttling.html#throttling-batches) section for details.

* **Added** – Custom `ParameterName`-based semaphore's owner id support, like in mutexes.
* **Added** – Support for throttling entire batches with semaphores when using `BatchId` as a parameter name.
