category: release

This version contains the most important changes for request/response processing pipeline since version 2.1 in terms of performance. LUA scripting feature is now used to implement transactions with proper locking, and it is much more efficient than the previous implementation based on conditional transactions. Less round-trips, reduced impact caused by latency, optimized distributed locks and better fetching from multiple queues makes this release so important, especially when using the package in a cloud environment.

* **Changed** – Rewrite transactions using LUA scripting to reduce number of round-trips to Redis.
* **Changed** – Optimize distributed lock acquisition logic to avoid extra polling and decrease latency.
* **Changed** – Implement fetching from multiple queues using only a single query for all of them.
* **Changed** – Avoid using conditional transactions where possible to avoid request pipeline stalls.
