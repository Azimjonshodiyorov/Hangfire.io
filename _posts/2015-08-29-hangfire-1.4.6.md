This is a maintenance release that fixes deadlocks in expiration manager, SQL command timeouts in distributed locks (and in the DisableConcurrentExecution filter) and correctly handles poison messages in a schedule.

* **Fixed** – SQL command timeout in `DisableConcurrentExecution` filter.
* **Fixed** – SQL deadlocks in `ExpirationManager` background process.
* **Fixed** – Too many queries in `SchedulePoller` when background job is missing or in another state.
