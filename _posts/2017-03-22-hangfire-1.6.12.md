This release brings better exception handling policy for state changing pipeline. Previously, non-transient exception in a state filter could cause a worker to perform retries for affected background job infinitely. And a large number of such background jobs could stall the processing.

The new logic makes 10 attempts to perform a state change using state filters. When all the attempts failed, it moves background job to the Failed state without calling any state filters.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – Buggy state filters may cause background job to be infinitely retried.
* **Fixed** – Transient exception during Processing-Succeeded state transition may cause unexpected retry.
