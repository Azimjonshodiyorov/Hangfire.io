title: Hangfire.Pro.Redis 2.8.0-beta1
category: [release, hangfire-pro]
author: odinserj
---

The new pre-release version brings significantly improved command pipeline with less stalls due to the absence of conditional transactions (now using LUA scripting instead of them), less round-trips to Redis, decreased latency when obtaining distributed locks and optimized fetching from multiple queues using a single command. These changes heavily increase the throughput especially when using Redis in a cloud environment or using complex features in Hangfire.

* **Changed** – Rewrite transactions using LUA scripting to reduce number of round-trips to Redis.
* **Changed** – Optimize distributed lock acquisition logic to avoid extra polling and decrease latency.
* **Changed** – Implement fetching from multiple queues using only a single query for all of them.
* **Changed** – Avoid using conditional transactions where possible to avoid request pipeline stalls.
