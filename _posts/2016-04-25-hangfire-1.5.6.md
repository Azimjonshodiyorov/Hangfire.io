This release fixes an issue related to SQL Azure and background jobs, running more than 30 minutes. The problem is caused by Azure Database Engine which [closes idle connections](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-security-guidelines/) after 30 minutes of inactivity. Hangfire now periodically sends "keep-alive" queries to prevent this.  

Please see the [corresponding release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.5.6) on GitHub for linked issues/PRs.
