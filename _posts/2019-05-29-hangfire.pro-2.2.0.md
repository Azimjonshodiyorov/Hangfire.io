title: Hangfire.Pro 2.2.0
category: [release, hangfire-pro]
author: odinserj

This is a maintenance release that plays better with recently released Hangfire 1.7, so you don't get extra framework packages when targeting .NET Core or .NET Standard 2.0. Also, continuation filters now don't throw an exception again and again, when continuation has already expired.

* **Added** – Separate target for .NET Standard 2.0 to reduce the number of dependencies.
* **Added** – `ContinueJobWith` and `ContinueBatchWith` methods to replace `AwaitXXX` ones and match Hangfire 1.7.
* **Fixed** – Avoid constant exception in some corner cases related to batch and job continuations.
