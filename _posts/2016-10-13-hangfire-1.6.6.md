This is a correcting release that fixes a regression, when using generic methods of a scoped variable in expression for  background jobs, as well as some minor optimizations for SQL Server. It also adds CLS compliance for basic packages, since public API is already compliant. Boring release, nothing interesting here.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – `Hangfire.Core`, `Hangfire.SqlServer` and `Hangfire.SqlServer.Msmq` marked as CLS-compliant.
* **Fixed** – Generic methods cause `ArgumentNullException` when scoped variable is used in expression.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – `SqlServerJobQueue` class doesn't use obsolete `InvisibilityTimeout` parameter anymore.
