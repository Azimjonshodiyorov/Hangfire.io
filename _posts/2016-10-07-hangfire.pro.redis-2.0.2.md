This release brings us a single package that targets both .NET Framework and .NET Core, so there's no need to use separate packages now. It also fixes a rare issue, when a timed out background job stays in the `processing` set indefinitely, causing dashboard exceptions.

* **Changed** – Single package for both .NET Core and .NET Framework.
* **Changed** – StackExchange.Redis package updated to 1.1.608.
* **Fixed** – Background job can stay in the `processing` set, if it was re-queued by watcher.
