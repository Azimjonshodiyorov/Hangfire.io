This version contains even better implementation of ASP.NET application shutdown detection logic – detection timer was replaced with a dedicated thread to make it work even when ASP.NET killed all the thread pool threads, and yet another check based on internal state was implemented for more reliable detection.

* **Fixed** – Don't consider `SecurityException` as a non-catchable one.
* **Fixed** – Replace timer with a dedicated thread in `AspNetShutdownDetector` to avoid depending on thread pool.
* **Fixed** – Better ASP.NET shutdown detection with yet another check based on internal state.
* **Fixed** – Decrease `AspNetShutdownDetector`'s check intervals to detect shutdowns earlier.
* **Fixed** – Don't wait for server stop on AppDomain unloads when hosting in IIS to avoid delaying them.
