2.5.4:
* **Fixed** – Possible reasons for timeouts in `FetchedJobsWatcher` class and `Heartbeat` method.

2.5.3:
* **Fixed** – Decrease reconnect time by using millisecond-based retry delays.

2.5.2:
* **Fixed** – Subscribe command now goes to the correct server even after manual fail-over.
* **Fixed** – Proper `PhysicalConnection.BeginReading` exception handling.
* **Fixed** – Automatically release all non-disposed locks when connection is closing.
* **Fixed** – Protect distributed locks from being disposed multiple times.
