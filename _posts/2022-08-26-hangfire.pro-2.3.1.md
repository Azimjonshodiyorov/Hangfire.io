This is a small maintenance release that just add missing overloads for the `ContinueBatchWith` method that allows to use background jobs based on asynchronous methods as continuations for batches. But this will unfortunately work only for .NET Core platform. Unfortunately support for .NET Framework will come only with version 3.0, because breaking changes required in this case.

* **Fixed** â€“ Add missing overloads for the `ContinueBatchWith` method to support async jobs for `netstandard` targets.
