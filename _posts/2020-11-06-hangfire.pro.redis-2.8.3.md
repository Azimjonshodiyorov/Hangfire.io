title: Hangfire.Pro.Redis 2.8.3
category: release

This version fixes regression appeared in 2.8.0 which leads to occasional `SemaphoreFullException` exception when distribute lock can't be obtained and timeout exception should be thrown instead. Also the `RelyOnInternalReconnects` experimental option was added to test less aggressive reconnection logic built into SE.Redis package.

By default Hangfire.Pro.Redis is using a custom connection manager that aggressively reconnects by creating a brand new multiplexer each time there is any problem to avoid numerous problems with network blips in cloud environments. But there were a lot of changes made to SE.Redis since connection manager appeared, and this experimental option allows to use less aggressive reconnection logic built into StackExchange.Redis itself.

* **Added** – Experimental `RedisStorageOptions.RelyOnInternalReconnects` to rely on less aggressive SE.Redis' logic for reconnects.
* **Fixed** – Occasional `SemaphoreFullException` when distribute lock acquisition failed due to timeout.
* **Fixed** – Both configured and actual endpoints now shown in logs when connecting to Redis to avoid confusion.
