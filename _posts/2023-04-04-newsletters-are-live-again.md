Last year we lost access to our MailChimp account due to the war in Ukraine. We used this service to send an automatic newsletters based on blog posts. Unfortunately, we couldn't restore the account or obtain the list of subscribers to simplify the migration process. And also unfortunately, I didn't remove the subscribe forms and links from our website, so almost everyone who tried to subscribe last year thinks it's still broken.

I was finally able to restore this feature this March, so the newsletters are now up and running. However, since the last newsletter was sent more than a year ago, and since it is generally considered bad practice to reconstruct the subscriber lists in this case, they are almost empty now.

If you'd like to get [monthly updates](https://news.hangfire.io/h/y/FA03311D02C92F37) or [security announcements](https://news.hangfire.io/h/y/0EB5787B750EB944), please subscribe again by visiting the referenced pages. Sorry for the inconvenience.
