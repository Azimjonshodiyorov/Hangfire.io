This patch version contains improved logging for SSL/TLS authentication routine to understand what's actually happened when something went wrong with the `DEBUG` log level enabled for the `Hangfire.Pro.Redis` namespace.

* **Added** – Ambient way through the environment variable to trust certificate issuer based on path.
* **Fixed** – Include inner exception when SSL/TLS authentication failed in logs.
* **Fixed** – Catch `SocketException` in the `SocketManager.Shutdown` method when socket is not connected.
