Finally Redis Cluster is officially supported by Hangfire.Pro.Redis package, and correctly handles the corner cases of Redis' async replication. I was able to implement it without requiring [RedLock](https://redis.io/topics/distlock) algorithm, regular `WATCH` commands are used to ensure distributed lock correctness. 

This is a big win, because you don't need to have N separate detached masters just to ensure locks are working correctly, so can save some time and money :tada:! I will make a final release after more testing, but the changes are very simple, and you can use it now, at least on staging environments.

* **Added** – Redis Cluster is fully supported without RedLock algorithm and additional masters.
* **Changed** – `abortConnect` option is now specified by default.
* **Changed** – StackExchange.Redis updated to 1.2.1 for the `net45` target.
* **Changed** – Remove dependency on the Microsoft.NETCore.Portable.Compatibility package.
* **Deprecated** – `RedisStorageOptions.AllowMultipleEndPointsWithoutRedLock` is now obsolete, just remove it.
