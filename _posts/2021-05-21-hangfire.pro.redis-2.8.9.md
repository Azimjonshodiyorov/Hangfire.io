This maintenance release adds more logging only, but now almost every exception that occurs inside StackExchange.Redis package is logged with the `DEBUG` log level. So internal errors can be tracked now much faster than before.

* **Fixed** – Log almost every exception that occurs inside StackExchange.Redis package through integrated logging.
* **Fixed** – Don't clog the log with "Transaction discarded…" messages from `FetchedJobsWatcher` component.
