This is a correcting release that fixes `Server.StartedAt` field reset problem during each server heartbeat, which lead to confusion that servers are constantly restarted, when watching the Servers page. It also adds missing `GetValueFromHash` method required by popular [Hangfire.Console](https://github.com/pieceofsummer/Hangfire.Console) extension.

* **Fixed** – The `Server.StartedAt` value is not reset on each heartbeat, when server is active.
* **Fixed** – Added missing `RedisConnection.GetValueFromHash` method, required by [Hangfire.Console](https://github.com/pieceofsummer/Hangfire.Console).
