This version contains **security fixes** to prevent possible XSS attacks as described in [#1441](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/issues/1441). They don't relate to user data submitted to Hangfire directly via method arguments, but it's recommended to upgrade anyway. If you are using Hangfire 1.6, please upgrade to version [1.6.26](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.6.26) instead.

### Reporting security issues 

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. Please email us at [security@hangfire.io](security@hangfire.io) with details and we will respond ASAP. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work. We can and do mark releases as "urgent" if they contain serious security fixes.
