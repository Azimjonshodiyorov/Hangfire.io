This patch release fixes a regression appeared in 2.8 version related to the LUA-based transaction implementation, which didn't take StackExchange.Redis's `ChannelPrefix` option into account when enqueueing a background job id, causing the processing to hang when custom channel prefix is used.

* **Fixed** â€“ Respect the `ChannelPrefix` configuration option when enqueueing a job identifier.
