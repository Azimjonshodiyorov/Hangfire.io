This release fixes unexpected behaviors when we are cancelling a batch that has continuations for its inner items as in the following sample. When those continuations have continuations themselves, or when we attaching a job with continuation to a cancelled batch, our leaf-level continuations stuck in the awaiting or non-initialized state until queued manually.

Sounds a bit crazy, but here's an example:

<pre><code><span class="keywd">var</span> batchId = <span class="type">BatchJob</span>.StartNew(batch => { batch.Enqueue(() => LongRunning()); });

<span class="keywd">string</span> jobId = <span class="keywd">null</span>;

<span class="type">BatchJob</span>.AwaitBatch(batchId, batch => { jobId = batch.Enqueue(() => LongRunning()); });

<span class="comm">// This batch will be always in the awaiting state before the fix</span>
<span class="type">BatchJob</span>.AwaitJob(jobId, batch => batch.Enqueue(() => LongRunning())); 

<span class="type">BatchJob</span>.Cancel(batchId);</code></pre>

* **Fixed** – Continuation stuck in a non-initialized state, when parent batch of antecedent item is canceled.
* **Fixed** – Leaks in the `Set` table when cancelling a batch that has continuations for its jobs.
