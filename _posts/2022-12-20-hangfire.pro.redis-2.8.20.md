This version has a compatibility patch for highly popular Hangfire.Console extension so it can't slow down the background processing when CLR's Thread Pool is starved.

* **Changed** – Don't use async query pipelining in the `RedisMonitoringApi.JobDetails` method.
* **Fixed** – Hangfire.Console extension doesn't slow down processing when CLR's Thread Pool is starved.
