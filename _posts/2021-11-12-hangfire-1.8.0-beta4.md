The last preview version of the 1.8 release that adds support for dark mode for Dashboard UI (`UseDarkModeSupportForDashboard` configuration method should be called, since extension packages don't support this mode yet), allow to use custom JavaScript and CSS files and improve default settings for SQL Server-based job storage to match the recommended options whenever possible.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Added** – Dark mode support for Dashboard UI configurable with the `UseDarkModeSupportForDashboard` method.
* **Added** – Allow to add custom JavaScript and CSS files to the Dashboard UI via the `DashboardRoutes` class.
* **Added** – Ability to use custom formattable resource identifiers for the `DisableConcurrentExecutionAttribute`.
* **Changed** – Increase the default value for the `BackgroundJobServerOptions.StopTimeout` to 500 ms.
      
**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Added** – `TryAutoDetectSchemaDependentOptions` option to automatically enable options based on schema.
* **Changed** – `GetJobData` now populates `JobData.ParametersSnapshot` property to avoid additional round-trips.
* **Changed** – Polling delay when `QueuePollInterval` is set to zero now defaults to 200 ms.
* **Deprecated** – `UsePageLocksOnDequeue` option is now obsolete and doesn't affect anything.
