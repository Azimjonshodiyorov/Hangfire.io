Hangfire 1.6 just released with experimental .NET Core platform support, deep integration with ASP.NET Core and `async`/`await` programming model support. Start processing background jobs with ease even on Linux and OS X today! 

### Async Methods for Background Jobs

Async programming became very popular in .NET a long time ago. With the `await` keyword it won an even greater success – some libraries even don't provide synchronous API (like [Microsoft.Net.Http](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Http/)), so we can't ignore this movement. In the past you had to await your methods manually, but those days are over.

#### Support for the `await` Keyword

The `await` keyword is fully supported in background methods now. So you can replace all the methods that were required to run `async` methods synchronously (`Task.Wait`, `AsyncContext`, etc.). Big thanks to [@tuespetre](https://github.com/tuespetre) for the initial implementation of this feature!

```csharp
public static async Task HighlightAsync(int snippetId)
{
    var snippet = await _dbContext.CodeSnippets.SingleOrDefaultAsync(x => x.Id == snippetId);
    if (snippet == null) return;

    snippet.HighlightedCode = await HighlightSourceAsync(snippet.SourceCode);
    snippet.HighlightedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;

    await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

If you want to return a result, use the `Task<T>` as a returning type instead. Please note that `async void` methods **aren't supported**, and an exception will be thrown at runtime. This was implemented to reduce the number of issues, because *async void* methods can't be awaited.

The enqueueing logic is the same for sync and async methods. In early betas there was a warning [CS4014](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873131.aspx), but now you can remove all the `#pragma warning disable` statements. It was implemented by using `Expression<Func<Task>>` parameter overloads.

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => HighlightAsync(snippet.Id));
``` 

#### Cancellation Tokens

If your async methods support `CancellationToken` parameters, don't forget to add them to allow background processing server to stop gracefully during the application shutdown. With this release Hangfire is able to pass `CancellationToken` instance to your methods.

```csharp
public static async Task HighlightAsync(int snippetId, CancellationToken token)
{
     // ...
}
```

When creating a background job, pass whatever `CancellationToken` you want, but it's better to use the `CancellationToken.None` to not to confuse anyone.

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => HighlightAsync(snippetId, CancellationToken.None));
```

#### That's not a real asynchrony

Please consider this feature as a syntactic sugar. Background processing hasn't became asynchronous. Internally it was implemented using the `Task.Wait` method, so workers don't perform any processing, while waiting for a task completion. Real asynchrony may come in Hangfire 2.0 only, and it requires a lot of breaking changes to the existing types.

### Experimental .NET Core Support

Experimental support for .NET Core platform was added in this release by targeting [.NET Standard 1.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library) platform. ~~We aren't able to run automatic tests for Hangfire yet, because some required packages weren't ported to .NET Core (like [Moq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq)), so some edge cases may not work. All the tests should be running automatically on Windows, Linux and OS X in a near future to remove the *experimental* warning.~~ Unit tests are now running automatically on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/HangfireIO/Hangfire) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/odinserj/hangfire-525), covering Windows, Linux and OS X!

Client API, Server API and Dashboard UI are working fine, please see the [http://coredemo.hangfire.io/](http://coredemo.hangfire.io/) sample. It's hosted in a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)'s droplet based on Ubuntu 14.04 with no Windows involved at all! Please note that some packages like [Hangfire.Dashboard.Authorization](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Dashboard.Authorization/) are not available for .NET Core platform yet.

### ASP.NET Core Integration

Dashboard UI was abstracted from OWIN to support new ASP.NET Core's HTTP abstractions natively and move away from the OWIN dependency. The new `Hangfire.AspNetCore` package enables deep integration with ASP.NET Core applications for **both .NET 4.5.1 and .NET Core platforms**, including:

* **Dashboard UI** – new middleware that is based on the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions/) allows to use it in ASP.NET Core applications without additional dependencies.
* **Logging** – the package provides `ILogProvider` interface implementation that uses [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions/) library.
* **Dependency Injection** – implementation of the `JobActivator` class based on [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions/) package is used by default.

All you need is to install the new package via NuGet.

```
Install-Package Hangfire.AspNetCore
```

Configuration logic is as simple as always – there are extension methods for `IServiceCollection` and `IApplicationBuilder` interfaces.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Hangfire;

namespace MyWebApplication
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            // Configures Hangfire with the following methods exposed on 
            // the IGlobalConfiguration interface, and registers all the
            // required classes, including logging and DI, using new DI 
            // abstraction.
            services.AddHangfire(x => x.UseSqlServerStorage("<connection string>"));
        }
        
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            // app.AddLogger...

            // Creates and starts a new background job server instance,
            // and registers an application stop handler for graceful
            // shutdown.
            app.UseHangfireServer();

            // Enables the Dashboard UI middleware to listen on `/hangfire`
            // path string.
            app.UseHangfireDashboard();

            // MVC app.UseMvc...
        }
    }
}

```

### … And More!

* Zero-latency processing when client and server reside in the same process when using SQL Server (by @bgurmendi).
* Access to background job context from the `JobActivator.BeginScope` method.
* Add `LatencyTimeoutAttribute` To delete jobs if timeout is exceeded (by @Excommunicated).
* Ability to change statistics polling interval in dashboard (by @tristal).
* `SqlServerStorage` class constructor now takes `DbConnection` instances (by @tystol).

For the whole list please see the [corresponding GitHub release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.6.0). 

### Upgrading

I've tried hard to not to introduce breaking changes for current users. As a result, only some Dashboard UI's classes and interfaces were deprecated, but *still available* till Hangfire 2.0. **Other types were not changed in Hangfire that target the .NET 4.5 platform**.

 `IAuthorizationFilter` interface was deprecated and replaced with the more abstract [`IDashboardAuthorizationFilter`](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/blob/4dec6435fb552364833c359079230ad04fd98e53/src/Hangfire.Core/Dashboard/IDashboardAuthorizationFilter.cs) interface. To avoid warning messages, consider updating your filters to the new interface, and use the following property to enable them:

```csharp 
app.UseHangfireDashboard("/hangfire", new DashboardOptions
{
    Authorization = new [] { new MyAuthorizationFilter() }
});
```

`IRequestDispatcher` interface was also replaced with the `IDashboardDispatcher` one, and this change caused some methods of `RouteCollection` class to be deprecated. Please see the `obsolete` warning messages, they will tell you what type or method to use.
