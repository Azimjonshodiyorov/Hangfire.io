New version fixes a regression appeared in 1.7.13 which causes unexpected duplicate entries in the `JobParameters` table when using SQL Server as a job storage with older schemas (V5 and below). This problem is caused by a changed query in the previous version, and that change is rolled back now. No other manual steps required to fix the issue.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Changed** – Use better queries for jobs with 3 and 4 parameters, this is a common case.
* **Fixed** – Duplicate entries in the `JobParameters` table after upgrading to version 1.7.13.
* **Fixed** – Extensive retries on a method that has a retry attribute after upgrading to 1.7.13.
* **Fixed** – "ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: RetryCount" in `SqlServerMonitoringApi`.
