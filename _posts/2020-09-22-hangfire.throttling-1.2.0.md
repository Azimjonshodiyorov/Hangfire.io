New release brings support to detach background jobs from mutexes and semaphores without changing their state. New buttons added to the Dashboard UI, and new methods added to the `ThrottlingManager` class (but not to the interface to avoid breaking changes) to support the new feature.

* **Added** – "Detach jobs" button for mutexes and semaphores to detach jobs without touching their state.
* **Added** – `DetachFromMutex` and `DetachFromSemaphore` methods for `ThrottlingManager` class.
* **Added** – Pass full `BackgroundJob` class instance when obtaining custom mutex descriptions.
