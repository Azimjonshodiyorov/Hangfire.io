This is an important maintenance release that fixes regressions appeared in version 2.8.0. Please consider upgrading especially if you are using batches with 25,000 background jobs and more.

* **Fixed** – "RedisServerException: ERR Protocol error: invalid multibulk length" exceptions with large transactions.
* **Fixed** – Split large `EVAL` commands into multiple smaller ones to work around Redis limitations.
* **Fixed** – Handle distributed lock key expiration without causing a timeout.
* **Fixed** – Show configured endpoints in exception message when reconnect is in progress.
* **Fixed** – Don't clear the reconnect reason when reconnecting to show it in logs properly.
* **Fixed** – `NullReferenceException` in `PhysicalConnection.BeginReading` when multiplexer disposed too early.
