This release contains a bunch of fixes **for batches**, and is **recommended for anyone** who use them. Batches now always created in a correct state (Started, Completed or Succeeded), depending of state of its jobs. This is the most important change that fixes weird problems with batches that hanging forever.

**Hangfire.Pro**

* **Fixed** – Batches were hanging indefinitely in a started state, when using continuations for finished jobs.
* **Fixed** – Batches are always created in a correct state, even if its jobs were already finished.
* **Fixed** – "continuation" set key now correctly expiring, when parent batch already finished.
* **Fixed** – Don't serialize immutable properties of a batch state.
* **Fixed** – Add more descriptive messages for continuation state change reasons.
* **Fixed** – Do not expire empty "pending" and "processing" sets on final state transitions.
