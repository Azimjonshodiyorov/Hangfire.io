This is a maintenance release that contains fixes for job continuations and some dashboard issues related to Content Security Policy and recurring jobs page. It's highly recommended to upgrade to prevent problems with continuations. They are rare, but lead to significant headache.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – Duplicate job continuations aren't added anymore, when outer transaction has failed.
* **Fixed** – Existing duplicate continuations don't lead to `ArgumentException`: the same key already added.
* **Fixed** – Replace inline script, because it may violate the Content Security Policy (by @Beczka).
* **Fixed** – Don't skip records in RecurringJobsPage (by @reaction1989).
