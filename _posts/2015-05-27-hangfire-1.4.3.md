This is a correcting release that allows Hangfire to work with databases with case-sensitive and binary collations and fixes some other problems. Integration tests now are running against a case-sensitive database to reduce the probability of a mistake.

### Release Notes

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – `OverflowException` on the Job Details page when latency is too high.
* **Fixed** – Job serialization fix when using the `TypeNameHandling.All` option.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – SQL Server storage does not work with case-sensitive and binary collations.
* **Fixed** – "Incorrect syntax near 'MERGE'" error in the `CountersAggregator` component.

Please see the [corresponding release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.4.3) on GitHub for the linked issues.
