This release reduces the network bandwidth consumption in environments with hundreds of servers and hundreds of queues. There were unnecessary calls to `SMEMBERS servers` command in the `FetchedJobsWatcher` component responsible for fault detection, leading to ServerCount*QueueCount number calls to it.

* **Fixed** â€“ Reduce the number of calls to `SMEMBERS servers` command by fault detector when there are a lot of queues.
