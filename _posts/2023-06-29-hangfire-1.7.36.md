This correcting release fixes possible `ObjectDisposedException` in tests when using a background job server as a hosted process in ASP.NET Core, and a rare issue with the delayed job scheduler, when a scheduled background job was changed bypassing Hangfire API.

#### Hangfire.Core

* **Fixed** – Remove job id from schedule when it's not in the Scheduled state for some reason.

#### Hangfire.NetCore and Hangfire.AspNetCore

* **Changed** – Set processing server to `null` in hosted service to avoid `ObjectDisposedException`.
