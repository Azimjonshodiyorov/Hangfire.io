This release fixes a problem that caused `SqlConnection` instance to leak when nested distributed locks are acquired for the same resource. If you are using batches, or continuations, and SQL Server as a storage, it is highly recommended to upgrade to prevent connection pool starvation and timeout exceptions.

* **Fixed** â€“ `SqlConnection` object leaks when using nested distributed locks (in batches and continuations).
