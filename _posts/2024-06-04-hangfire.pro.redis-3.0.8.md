summary: Automatic cleanup of empty queues or queues full of expired jobs so they don't stuck in the Dashboard UI.
---

This maintenance release includes automatic cleanup logic for empty queues or queues full of expired jobs to prevent them from getting stuck in the Dashboard UI. Additionally, it addresses a memory leak issue related to transaction-level locks introduced in Hangfire 1.8.0.

* **Changed** – De-register empty or abandoned queues with only expired jobs automatically.
* **Changed** – Include command and key reference in command-related exceptions from Redis.
* **Fixed** – Don't leak lock instances in the extender process when using transaction-level locks.
