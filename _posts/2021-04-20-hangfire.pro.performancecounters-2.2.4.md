This release fixes problems with missing performance counter instances in Performance Monitor due to changed instance naming rules in `Microsoft.Owin.*` packages of version 3.X and the absence of instance name sanitization.

* **Added** – Overload for the `UseHangfirePerformanceCounters` method with explicit instance name.
* **Fixed** – Sanitize instance name for performance counters to support Katana 3+.
