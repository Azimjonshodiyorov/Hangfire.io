This is a minor update that fixes VS Code debugger crash on OS X, and don't report `ThreadAbortException` as
fatal. You can update only if these issues annoys you.

* **Fixed** – Don't report `ThreadAbortException` as fatal in the `ConnectionLoop` method.
* **Fixed** – Debugger crashes when Hangfire.Pro.Redis is referenced in VS Code on macOS.
