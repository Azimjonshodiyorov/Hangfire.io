This release adds the `IGlobalConfiguration.UseMaxLinesInExceptionDetails` option to cap exception details when background jobs fail with an exception and forces only the first 100 lines of a stack trace to be persisted by default to avoid uncontrollable storage size growth. Also some improvements for SQL Server storage were added.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Added** – `IGlobalConfiguration.UseMaxLinesInExceptionDetails` option to cap the size of stack traces.
* **Changed** – Only the first 100 lines of a stack trace will be preserved now by default in Failed state.
* **Fixed** – Don't let exceptions with huge stack traces take up too much storage space.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – Avoid deadlocks when using the `SetJobParameter` method without introducing issues for older schemas.
* **Fixed** – Remove duplicate sorting in the `SqlServerMonitoringApi.GetJobs` method which is used by a lot of queries.
