This release adds an option that explicitly allows using multiple endpoints in the connection string, but it's **not recommended**.  Use it at your own risk! Here's a small explanation:

* **Distributed locks may not provide the safety property** (their primary property) in edge cases, for example when failover occurs when NodeA has just acquired a lock, but the lock acquisition wasn't replicated, so it's possible for NodeB to re-acquire the same lock. This problem is solved by implementing the [RedLock algorithm](http://redis.io/topics/distlock) proposed by Salvatore Sanfilippo (the author of Redis), but it's not currently implemented.
* **There were problems with subscriptions in the past**. StackExchange.Redis [doesn't provide](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/blob/master/Docs/PipelinesMultiplexers.md#multiplexing) blocking commands like BRPOPLPUSH, that are very important for queue processing, due to its multiplexed behavior. The workaround is to use Redis pub/sub to get the blocking semantics, but there were problems when I tried to use them in a cluster environment. Looks like [this PR](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/452) fixed this, but I need to ensure.

**Added** â€“ `AllowMultipleEndPointsWithoutRedLock` option that explicitly allows to use multiple endpoints.
