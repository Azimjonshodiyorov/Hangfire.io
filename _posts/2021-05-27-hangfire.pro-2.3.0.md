It is now possible to add batch continuations with new `OnlyOnCompletedState` and `OnlyOnDeletedState` options. The `BatchContinuationOptions` enum now allows to specify multiple values, so it is possible to mix different options to create a continuation that fire in multiple cases. For example continuations with `OnlyOnSucceededState | OnlyOnCompletedState` option specified will only be executed once antecedent batch is either succeeded or completed – but not deleted, e.g. canceled.

* **Added** – It is possible to use `OnlyOnCompletedState` and `OnlyOnDeletedState` options for batch continuations.
* **Added** – Make it possible to specify multiple `BatchContinuationOptions` for batch-to-batch continuations.
* **Added** – Allow to specify multiple `BatchContinuationOptions` for batch-to-job continuations.
* **Added** – Allow to use multiple `JobContinuationOptions` values for job-to-batch continuations.
* **Added** – Show job continuations on the "Batch Details" page in Dashboard UI.
* **Changed** – `BatchContinuationOptions` enum is now decorated with the `FlagsAttribute` attribute.
