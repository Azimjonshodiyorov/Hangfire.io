Hangfire is published as NuGet packages, as are nearly all of the extensions. If you have NuGet installed, you can right-click on your project and choose `Add Library Package Reference`. Search for <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Hangfire">Hangfire</a>, and you should see a list of packages. Click *Install*, and you're done. Here are the example packages:

* [Hangfire.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Core/)
* [Hangfire.AspNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.AspNet/)
* [Hangfire.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.AspNetCore/)
* [Hangfire.InMemory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.InMemory/)
* [Hangfire.NetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.NetCore/)
* [Hangfire.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.SqlServer/)

## Continuous Integration Feed

Can't wait for a new release? Not a problem as there is a continuous integration feed for Hangfire packages hosted in [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/). After each successful commit to the `master` or `dev` branches or any open pull request based on these branches, pre-release packages are pushed to the feed automatically. Here is its url:

    https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/hangfire

### Adding the feed

To configure a CI feed in Visual Studio open **Tools &rarr; NuGet Package Manager &rarr; Package Manager Settings** and add a new feed.

To configure a project NuGet feed on your development machine run this command:

    nuget sources add -Name hangfire-ci -Source https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/hangfire-6d3854sflnyb

### Updating packages

After adding the feed, use the NuGet Package Manager to obtain new versions of packages. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the **References** node and click **Manage NuGet Packages...** and ensure that **Include Prerelease** option is turned on.
